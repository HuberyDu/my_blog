#CFMSF
SJTU CFMSF Web Portal

The current version of SJTU CFMSF web portal is not powerful enough to support their education workload. The current design and functionality is not attractive to their students. The new version is supposed to be in a fashion design with trend technology. Front-end pages will be clear and decent while backend management pages will be very user-friendly and powerful. All the content and front-end pages will be in both Chinese and French. And they will be very consistent.
