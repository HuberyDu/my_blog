          THE HAKONE EKIDEN IS A TWO-DAY RELAY RACE WATCHED BY TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN JAPAN. IN THIS HISTORIC RACE, RUNNERS FROM EACH TEAM PASS A SASH CALLED A “TASUKI” ALONG THE 217 KILOMETER ROUTE. THIS YEAR NIKE DEVELOPED A UNIQUE WAY TO CHEER ON THE FIVE MAIN UNIVERSITIES THEY SUPPORT.
        %p
          During the race @nikerun_jp tweeted original ASCII art supporting each university based on the current stage of the event. Each piece of art contained a tasuki within the design, which made the simple act of retweeting to your followers a metaphor for passing the tasuki in the actual race. Then on a special campaign website each RT was counted towards the parallel race happening on Twitter. John.Thank you.
