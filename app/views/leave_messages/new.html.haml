    There are 2 options:
  %p
    (a) When the project is clearly defined in scope and time, we propose a Project model. Under this model, we work together prior to the project to formulate a detailed project plan based on your needs. We then assemble a team for a limited period of time with a Project Lead responsible for the quality and timing of deliveries.

    (b) When our client requires an extension of its team with flexibility in the scope of tasks, a retainer model may be more suitable. Under this model, a team will be put together upon your request. Its tasks can be defined and modified on the go, just as you would with an internal team. You will have the guarantee that the resources will be retained for you over the long term.
