#     # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user 
#     # permission to do.
#     # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
#     # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
#     #
#     # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on. 
#     # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
#     # class of the resource.
#     #
#     # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
#     # objects.
#     # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
#     #
#     #   can :update, Article, :published => true
